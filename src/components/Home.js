        <p>Vivekanand Education Society was founded in 1959 by Shri. Hashu Advani, along with ten other members, who shared the dream of providing qualitative education to the youth of our country. In the beginning, Vivekanand Education Society had a very modest launch, with just 256 students and six classrooms, in the humble barracks of Chembur Camp. But today, it proudly boast of having 3, 75, 000 sq. ft. land, housing 12 buildings and 28 Institutions, ranging from a cr√®che to Ph.D. Centers. It has over 2000 teaching and non-teaching staff, and more than 18,000 students who pass through its hallowed portals each year.</p>
